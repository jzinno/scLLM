## Description

These are the main initial notebooks for the generative models. Starting first with `scT5.ipynb` which the training [`t5-base`](https://huggingface.co/t5-base) on the [Tabula Sapiens](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/53d208b0-2cfd-4366-9866-c3c6114081bc.cxg/) dataset of almost 500k cells with the task of generatively annotating cell type based on cell sentences. `flan-t5` and a larger `GPT-2` architecture are next in line.
